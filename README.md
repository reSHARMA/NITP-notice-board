# NITP-notice-board
A web extention compatible with chrome and firefox
It displays all the notices from NIT-Patna using web scraping , data mining , some node API and web extentions.

It is already published at chrome web store https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nit-patna-notice-board/djkeeegaenchebkmfadogkammfjghjaf

I'm aiming to make it a tool, that can be used with any college provided the link to there homepage (A fancy aim)

I wrote this in 2 days :/ before the exams in 3rd sem. Forgive the bad quality of code.
I could not find a free database hosting platform back in 2016 so till now this directly scraps and dumps in the extention.


Looking for contributors as I don't find time for this these days.
